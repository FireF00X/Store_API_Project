# Store Project

## Description
The Store Project is a robust API developed using .NET, following the Onion Architecture principles. This application is integrated with a SQL Server database and features user authentication, including login, registration, and logout functionalities. It employs dependency injection for a modular and maintainable codebase. The project also includes data seeding for populating initial data and implements a generic repository along with the unit of work pattern for efficient data management.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and logout processes.
- **SQL Server Integration**: Efficient data management using SQL Server.
- **Onion Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns and modular design.
- **Dependency Injection**: Enhances maintainability and testing.
